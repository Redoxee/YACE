# YACE : Yet Another Card Engine

- Ambition

YACE is a card game engine, it should provide a framework to make video card games.
The goal is to provide a unified language to describe cards effect ex : 
"Select all Enemie entities and Apply 5 Damage"
Idealy, the framework should leavy an tag entity system to provide a flexible tool.
By using a format such as JSON to describe cards and rules and a command based finite state machine, the YACE should provide online multiplayer.
